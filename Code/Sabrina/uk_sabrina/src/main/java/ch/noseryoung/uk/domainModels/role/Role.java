// This is an example class on a domain model could be built
// These annotations show hibernate that this is an entity
@Entity
// This annotation defines this entity as it's own table with it's given name
// We can also not define it's name, but then it'd take the name of the class itself and that wouldn't be best practice

    // Regular attributes
    // The primary key, this annotation defines that this is a primary key:
    @Id

    // This annotation simply defines that this attribute has it's own column and how that column is called

    // Firstly we define the name of the table
    // Secondly we define the foreign key which leads to this entity
    // Lastly we define the foreign key which leads to the other entity we possess a relation to
    // In many to many relations the data type is preferred to be a Set for performance, in one to many and many to one
    // relations the preferred data type are lists.
